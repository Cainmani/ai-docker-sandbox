2. **Run**: Double-click `AI_Docker_Manager.exe` → Select "**1. FIRST TIME SETUP**"
3. **Wizard Steps**:
   - Enter username and password for Linux container
   - Select parent directory for AI_Work folder (don't move this folder later!)

## 📁 File Access

**Inside Container**: `/workspace` = **On Windows**: Your AI_Work folder

Files sync automatically both ways! Edit from Windows or from Claude - changes appear everywhere.

## 🔧 Common Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Docker is not running" | Start Docker Desktop, wait for green icon, retry |
| "container does not exist" | Run First Time Setup first |
| "claude: command not found" | Re-run First Time Setup |
| "Permission denied" | Use `sudo` command (your password from setup) |
| Can't find AI_Work folder | Check `.env` file for `WORKSPACE_PATH=` |

## ⚠️ Important Rules

✅ **DO**: Create project subdirectories in AI_Work
✅ **DO**: Use "Launch AI Workspace" for daily access
✅ **DO**: Access files from Windows File Explorer anytime

❌ **DON'T**: Move or rename AI_Work folder after setup
❌ **DON'T**: Run "First Time Setup" again (unless intentionally resetting)
❌ **DON'T**: Close Docker Desktop while using Claude

## 📋 Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Launch AI_Docker_Manager.exe → "2. LAUNCH AI WORKSPACE"

# 2. Inside terminal:
cd /workspace
mkdir my-website
cd my-website

# 3. Start Claude:
claude

# 4. Now ask Claude to help you build something!
# Example: "Help me create a simple HTML website with a contact form"

# 5. Files will appear in: AI_Work\my-website\ (on Windows)
```

## 🆘 Quick Help

- **Authentication**: Only needed first time you run `claude`
- **Your files**: Always in AI_Work folder on Windows
- **Sudo access**: Use your setup password if prompted
- **Exit Claude**: Press `Ctrl+C` or type `exit`
